# LS-RACING
Formula 1 simulation videogame that allows the player to race a full F1 season against other players and win the championship.

The program allows the player to configure his F1 car and compete with the rest of the vehicles, in pursuit of championship.

Races are watched in real time.

Concepts developed in this project:

- Processing of text and binary files.
- Work with the computer clock using the time.h library.
- Use of dynamic memory.
- Structuring the code into modules. 
- Implement and properly use of data structures such as queues or lists.
- Work with external libraries, like Allegro.
